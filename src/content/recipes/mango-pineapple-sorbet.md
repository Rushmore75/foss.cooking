Designed to minimise air incorporation while delivering clean sweetness with a low-carb–friendly profile
(polyols included in label carbs but excluded from net carbs).

- ⏲️  Prep time: 20 min
- ❄️ Freeze time: 12 h
- 🍽️ Servings: 1-2

## Ingredients

- 125 g mango purée
- 112 g pineapple purée
- 220 g water
- 25 g erythritol
- 0.3 g salt
- 0.8 g xanthan gum
- 1 pellet sucralose

Total mass: approximately 485–490 g  
Rule of thumb: **fruit + water ≈ 460 g**

## Directions

1. Mixing (Texture-Critical)

   Recommended method: stand mixer.

   Blenders incorporate excess air and typically produce a lighter, icier texture in the Ninja Creami.

   - Add fruit purées, water, erythritol, salt, and sucralose to the bowl.
   - Mix on low speed until fully dissolved and homogeneous.
   - With the mixer running on low, slowly rain in the xanthan gum.
   - Mix for 30–60 seconds, just until the gum is fully hydrated and the base is smooth.

   If using a blender (not ideal):
   - Blend everything except xanthan on low speed.
   - Add xanthan last and blend briefly on low to hydrate.
   - Rest the base for 5–10 minutes to allow bubbles to rise and hydration to complete.

2. Freezing & Processing

   - Pour the base into the Ninja Creami pint and level the surface.
   - Freeze solid for at least 12 hours.
   - Process using one Sorbet cycle followed by one Re-Spin.

## Variations

Pure mango or pure pineapple versions work well by keeping the **fruit + water total at approximately 460 g**.

- **Mango-only**
  - Use mango purée only.
  - Add water as needed to reach a combined fruit + water mass of ~460 g.
  - Typical xanthan range: 0.5–0.6 g.

- **Pineapple-only**
  - Use pineapple purée only.
  - Add water as needed to reach a combined fruit + water mass of ~460 g.
  - Typical xanthan range: 0.9–1.0 g.

Mango contains significantly more functional pectin than pineapple, which explains the different stabiliser needs.

## Nutritional Information

Label carbs are nutrition-label carbohydrates.  
Net carbs exclude polyols (erythritol).

| Total carbohydrates (label) | ≈ 50 g | ≈ 10.3 g |
| Sugars | ≈ 25 g | ≈ 5.2 g |
| Polyols (erythritol) | 25 g | ≈ 5.2 g |
| Net / effective carbs | ≈ 25 g | ≈ 5.2 g |
| Protein | ≈ 1.5 g | ≈ 0.3 g |
| Fat | ≈ 0.6 g | ≈ 0.1 g |

| Sodium | ≈ 120 mg | ≈ 25 mg |

Calories assume erythritol contributes approximately 0 kcal.  
Values vary with fruit variety and purée brand.

## Notes

- Minimising air during mixing is critical for Creami texture.
- Low-carb friendly, but not keto.
