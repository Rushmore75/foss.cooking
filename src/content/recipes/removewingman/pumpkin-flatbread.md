## Ingredients

You can obviously switch certain toppings.

- Wheat flour, type 405 – 2 cups (about 8.8 oz)
- Olive oil – 5 tablespoons
- Salt – a pinch
- Water – ½ cup (about 3.4 fl oz)
- Fresh thyme – ½ oz (about 1 tablespoon chopped)
- Soy yogurt – ¾ cup (about 7 oz)
- Black pepper, ground – a pinch
- Hokkaido pumpkin – ½ piece (about 1 lb)
- Red onions – 2 pieces
- Pears – 2 pieces
- Walnut kernels – 2 tablespoons

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 465°F (top and bottom heat). 
2. In a bowl, knead together the flour, 3 tablespoons of olive oil, salt, and water into a smooth dough. Wrap the dough ball in plastic wrap and let it rest at room temperature.
3. Wash the thyme, shake it dry, pluck the leaves from the stems, and chop them. 
4. In a bowl, mix the soy yogurt with the thyme and season with salt and pepper.
5. Wash the pumpkin, cut it in half, scrape out the seeds with a spoon, and slice it thinly. Halve the onions, peel them, and slice into strips. Wash the pears, quarter them, remove the cores, and cut into thin slices.
6. Roll out the dough on a floured surface into two thin rectangles. Place each one on parchment paper and transfer to a baking sheet. 
7. Spread the soy yogurt mixture over the dough and top with pumpkin, pear, and onion slices. Bake in the oven for about 10 minutes, until golden brown.
8. Meanwhile, roughly chop the walnuts. Remove the pumpkin flatbreads from the oven, cut them into portions, sprinkle with walnuts, and serve.
9. Enjoy :)
